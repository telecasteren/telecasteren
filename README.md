## Hello there 👋

🔭 Continuously working on toning my front-end skills.<br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning **Rust** with [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), and _The_ [Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).<br/>
📚 Reading the 20th Anniversary Edition of [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45280024-the-pragmatic-programmer) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.
